---

### Summary  

![Launch process](assets/proposal_002.png)

This proposal outlines the agreement among Core Contributors (CC) that we are ready to launch Guru Network L3 on Base Mainnet on **November 20, 2024**. It includes the planned Phase 1 feature set, launch mechanism, and the introduction of community-driven governance, ensuring alignment between contributors, ecosystem growth, and community engagement.

---

### Background  
Guru Network has reached a point where robust infrastructure is essential to advance ecosystem products developed during the Testnet phase (*Guru App, Burning Meme, DexGuru, Data Warehouse, Block Explorer, AI Orchestration Node*). These products have laid the foundation for the network's evolution into a comprehensive Web3 infrastructure centered on **AI and process orchestration**. 

As we approach the Mainnet launch, establishing structured governance mechanisms and incentivizing community involvement are crucial for driving network growth.
